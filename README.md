# FamilyMap Server - CS 240 Project

This is the backend part of a Family Map application developed for the CS 240 class at BYU. It follows [this 13 page specification](https://students.cs.byu.edu/~cs240ta/fall2018/projects/family-map-server/FamilyMapServerSpecification.pdf). In summary, it handles a CRUD API for dealing with family members and the location of important life events. The code is fully tested as specified. Look at my list of repos to find the client side, also written in Java!
